    <h1>The History and Future of Quantum Computing</h1>
    <p>Quantum computing is a type of computational device that operates based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Its emergence has the potential to disrupt our current understanding of computing power. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition), allowing for parallel computations. As technology advances, quantum computing has evolved from theoretical concepts to practical reality, becoming a leading research frontier in computation and bringing limitless application potential. This report will explore the history, core principles, and prospects of quantum computing.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://quantumpedia.uk/a-brief-history-of-quantum-computing-e0bbd05893d0">I. The History of Quantum Computing</a></h2>
    <p>The history of quantum computing can be traced back to the early 20th century with the development of quantum mechanics. Physicists like Max Planck and Albert Einstein introduced the quantum theory explaining the behaviour of particles and their interactions at the subatomic level. These theories laid the foundation for the later development of quantum computing.</p>
    <p>Richard Feynman formally proposed the concept of quantum computing. In 1981 during a lecture, Feynman pointed out that classical computers are highly inefficient when simulating quantum systems. Thus, he suggested designing computers based on quantum mechanics to handle such complex computational tasks. Feynman's idea became the starting point for quantum computing research.</p>
    <p>In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor introduced a quantum algorithm known as "Shor's algorithm." This algorithm allows quantum computers to greatly accelerate the process of integer factorization, the basis of modern encryption systems. The proposal of Shor's algorithm marked the first step in taking quantum computing from theory to practical application.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">II. Core Principles of Quantum Computing</a></h2>
    <p>Unlike classical computers, where bits can only be in a state of 0 or 1, the basic unit of a quantum computer is a quantum bit (qubit), which can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1. In other words, qubits can represent multiple states simultaneously, enabling quantum computers to process various tasks in parallel, greatly enhancing computational efficiency.</p>
    <p>Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as quantum superposition. Superposition enables quantum computers to perform parallel processing that far exceeds the capabilities of classical computers. Quantum entanglement is another feature, where qubits become tightly correlated, allowing efficient information transmission even at great distances.</p>
    <p>Through superposition and entanglement, quantum computers can solve problems that classical computers cannot complete within a reasonable time frame. Classical computers rely on sequentially processing information, whereas quantum computers can handle multiple data points simultaneously.</p>
    
    <h2><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/technology/computing/google-and-nasa-achieve-quantum-supremacy/">III. Recent Research in Quantum Computing</a></h2>
    <p>In 2019, Google announced that its quantum computer Sycamore had achieved "quantum supremacy," meaning that a quantum computer was able to complete a task that a classical computer could not solve within a reasonable time frame. Sycamore completed a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a classical computer 10,000 years. This breakthrough demonstrated quantum computing’s powerful ability to tackle certain specific problems.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Quantum_Platform">2. IBM's Quantum Computing Development</a>: IBM is another major player in the field of quantum computing. The company has launched the quantum computing service "IBM Quantum," which allows users to access quantum computing resources via the cloud. IBM is working on commercializing quantum computers, aiming to apply this technology to a wide range of fields such as finance, material science, and drug development.</p>
    
    <p>Quantum computing is expected to bring unprecedented scientific and technological progress in the coming years as technology advances and challenges are overcome.</p>
